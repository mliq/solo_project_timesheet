# Feedback Animation Project
(Like a screensaver.)

1. have to use javascript and jquery
2. have to animate something
3. every 15 minutes keep a google spreadsheet, idea being a timesheet which allow us to bill clients.

At 10:00 we get data. 
Due at 3:00. 


## Possible ideas to implement

1. Highlight certain words somehow in a different color? Names, possibly also words of praise or verbs, positive emotions...
2. Place quotes in a separate file instead of script.js.
