# Feedback Animation Project
(Like a screensaver.)

1. have to use javascript and jquery
2. have to animate something
3. every 15 minutes keep a google spreadsheet, idea being a timesheet which allow us to bill clients.

At 10:00 we get data. 
Due at 3:00. 


## Ideas implemented
1. Cycles through list of quotes with fade in then out every few seconds.
2. Highlight names in a different color.
3. Place quotes in a separate file and load into memory.

## Possible ideas to implement

- Make words wrap as necessary so box can stay constant size?
- Cooler animations?
- Highlight words of praise or verbs, positive emotions, in another color?
